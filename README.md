**DESCRIPTION**: This code defines a dynamic and visually appealing portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It incorporates the GSAP library for smooth animations and transitions. The structure includes four key sections: a Home section with a hero message, an About section detailing the developer’s expertise, a Projects section showcasing work samples, and a Contact section with contact details. A navigation bar links to each section for easy access.

The script.js file implements GSAP animations, enhancing user engagement. Key features include:

Smooth entrance animations for text and buttons in the Home section.
Sliding effects for the navigation bar and section headings.
Staggered animations for project cards and scroll-triggered transitions for dynamic interactivity.
Elastic and easing effects for buttons, adding a professional touch.
The site’s responsive design ensures compatibility across devices. The inclusion of Three.js prepares for future 3D visual enhancements. This portfolio is a great starting point for showcasing skills and projects in a modern, user-friendly format.
